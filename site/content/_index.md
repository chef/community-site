      #### Free your applications from underlying infrastructure and make
      updates easy.


      Chef Habitat gives you and your team the capability to build, deploy, and
      run any application in any environment. Whether you’re focused on
      traditional data centers, cloud platforms, or containerized microservices,
      Habitat can help you define and codify your application and its
      dependencies, freeing you from confounding infrastructure constraints.


      Deploy your applications with confidence with Habitat’s built-in support
      for health checks, rolling updates, dependency management, and more.

      #### Infrastructure automation for hardened, consistent configuration at
      any scale.

      With Chef Infra, your infrastructure is defined as code, ensuring that
      configuration policies are flexible, versionable, testable, and human-readable. 


      Automate your system configuration on the platforms you need, whether in
      the cloud, in the data center, or in the field. Don’t solve the same
      problems over and over again! Automate them and give your team the ability
      to build innovations.

      #### Secure your infrastructure across your entire development lifecycle.


      Chef InSpec lets you describe security and compliance rules as code to
      share between your software engineers, operations, and security engineers.
      Describe your infrastructure security as code in a consistent fashion
      across all of your stakeholders.


      Your requirements become automated tests that can be run against
      traditional servers, containers, and cloud APIs, ensuring enforced
      consistent standards in every managed environment, at every stage of
      development.

      #### Incorporate Chef’s products into your Application Development
      Lifecycle and deliver new features with confidence.


      When your entire lifecycle is defined as code, your infrastructure
      definitions, security policies, and application dependencies are easily
      verifiable on their way to your production environment. The Chef
      Enterprise Automation Stack is a keystone component to your modern
      application delivery pipeline, supporting your projects throughout the
      entire application lifecycle.

## Chef Community

# We're better together

Community is the foundation of Chef. We believe that the best way to build software is in close collaboration with the people who use it, and the best way to use software is alongside those who build it.

Our greatest strength is our community. That is why as a community, we are committed to holding ourselves to a higher standard. This is captured in our [Code of Conduct].

Join us, whether online or in person, and let’s build the future of technology together.
