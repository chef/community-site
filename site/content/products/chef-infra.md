      Express your infrastructure configuration as code, and make your systems testable, portable, and auditable. Give your teams the freedom to focus on building new innovations, rather than on solving problems that have already been solved in the past. Automate your systems' adherence to declared desired state and focus on solving the most important problems that your teams face.
