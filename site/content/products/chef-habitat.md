  one: 
    header: Studio
    copy: >-
      The Chef Habitat Studio is a development kit for creating automated build and deployment plans for any application and then testing them in a clean-room environment. 


      * Define how your application is built, installed, and run with PowerShell or Bash and your code editor of choice.  


      * Isolate dependencies into atomic plans and then build an Application Manifest which links to all direct & transitive runtime dependencies and provides tuneable instructions to install and run the app.   


      * Leverage hundreds of pre-built plans for common dependencies such as .NET, jdk or gcc on the Chef Habitat community on GitHub. 
  two:
    header: Artifact
    copy: >-
      Habitat packages the Application Manifest into an immutable artifact called the Habitat Application Artifact (.HART) file. Artifacts can be exported to run in a variety of runtimes with zero refactoring or rewriting.  


      * Create a package in the local Studio or integrate with any automated pipeline solution using the same commands and build processes.  


      * Simplify audit and compliance processes by explicitly defining application dependencies and packaging an application with only what is required.   

      * Easily export to tarball, Docker, or directly to container registries (Azure Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, or Docker Hub).
  three:
    header: Supervisor
    copy: >-
      The Habitat Supervisor is a light-weight agent that runs on/in a server, virtual machine, or container and manages the application according to the instructions defined in the Habitat Plan. Tasks are defined via pre-set scripts called lifecycle hooks that are included as part of the application definition.  
      

      * Deploy and upgrade an application to any environment on-demand  
      
      
      * Automate health and compliance checks  
      

      * Templatize your configuration settings and update them as needed during runtime.
