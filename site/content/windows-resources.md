Chef Habitat provides a single way to deliver and manage Windows applications.  Automation instructions are defined in Powershell, but packaged with platform-agnostic commands that enable Habitat to export an application to run in multiple environments without refactoring. This enables supporting teams to modernize older applications and take advantage of new platforms.
